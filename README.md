#ORM (object relation Mapping)
ORM stands for Object-Relational Mapping and it is a technique used to query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented programming language like C# in ASP.NET.

ORM frameworks in ASP.NET, such as: 

Entity Framework
Dapper
NHibernate

provide a way to map database tables to classes and properties in the .NET programming language, saving developers from writing raw SQL queries.

These ORM frameworks also handle tasks such as tracking changes to objects, generating SQL queries, managing connections, and optimizing performance.
